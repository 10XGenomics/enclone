enclone includes software developed by the OpenSSL Project
for use in the OpenSSL Toolkit (http://www.openssl.org/).

Plain text tree visualization in enclone is based on
https://gitlab.com/Noughmad/ptree, by Miha Čančula.

The script install.sh reuses code from the rust language installation script.

We thank Ganesh Phad for suggesting localization by color in honeycomb plots.
