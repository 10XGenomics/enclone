NOTES

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. From a Mac, if you type "enclone VIS", when enclone starts up, it forks enclone in server
mode, still on the Mac.  We sometimes observe a 9.2 second delay in this operation.  We believe 
this is attributable to the MacOS Gatekeeper.  Gatekeeper checks executable codesigning.  Probably
because enclone is not codesigned, Gatekeeper attempts to determine if the enclone executable
is "ok", and times out after 9.2 seconds.  We think this only happens when the MAC IS OFFLINE.
Still, when offline, as best we can tell, eventually this behavior stops, but we don't know what
determines when that happens.  Rebuilding the executable restarts the delays.  Importantly, we
only know how Gatekeeper behaves on the version of OSX that we've tested.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.  For automated testing on a Mac, the command to test is test_vis.

Again this can be slow because of Gatekeeper behavior for enclone.  And again the slowness 
generally goes away, either if one is online or after a period of time.

Note that automated testing causes an enclone visual window to open on your Mac.

3. We have made various attempts to bypass Gatekeeper behavior:
(a) sudo spctl --master-disable
(b) xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine path
(c) system preferences ==> security and privacy ==> Privacy ==> Developer Tools ==> allow apps ...
However, none seem effective.
