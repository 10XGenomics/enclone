TO DO

1.  Make sure server dies.

2.  Need a regression test.

3.  Trim features and duplicated crates; reduce binary size.

4.  Vertical placement of legend in PLOT_BY_ISOTYPE is not great.

5.  Handle the case where tsh hasn't been started
    server says this: david.jaffe@tsh-jump.txgmesh.net: Permission denied (publickey).
    kex_exchange_identification: Connection closed by remote host

6.  What do we do about the truncation of printing to fifty clonotypes?

7.  tooltip

8.  the wraparound problem

9.  Make sure that client and server are the same version.

10. Handle the case where button is pushed twice, etc.

11. Have text-only mode for testing and development.

12. Need auto-update for binary (at least for Mac).

13. Clonotype printouts need to show not just the pictures, but also the group info
    and any additional stuff like trees.

14. Improve data shown for tooltip.

15. Refactor to keep tokio etc. out of cellranger.

16. Make code work for 0, 2 or more SVG files, see the code svgs[0] which is broken in general.

WAITING ON ICED

1.  Can't cut and paste text from the GUI window, except for the text input box.
    Looks like this is https:github.com/hecrj/iced/issues/36.

2.  Pretty, not plain.
    Enabling e.g. multicolor text is on the iced roadmap.

3.  Text in SVG objects does not show up.
    Known regression = https:github.com/hecrj/iced/issues/870.

4.  Place the scrollbar on the left side of the scrollable window.
    Asked on zulip chat if this is possible.

5.  Make the TextInput gracefully handle long inputs.
    This is https:github.com/hecrj/iced/issues/320.  Fix targetted for 1.0.

6.  Flaky behavior scrolling large texts.
    Issue filed: https:github.com/hecrj/iced/issues/897.

NICE TO HAVE

1.  Add font size slider for clonotype tables.

2.  Can carriage return be used instead of pushing a button?

3.  Bold some text on the help page.
    Probably not possible at this time, could ask on zulip chat.

4.  Use native ssh calls rather than ssh commands, as this might be faster and more robust.

5.  Enable plotting after initially starting GUI.

6.  Put plots in a scrollable window.

7.  Add scale slider for plots.
