TO DO

1.  Improve data shown for tooltip.

2.  Need a regression test.

3.  Trim features and duplicated crates; reduce binary size.

4.  What do we do about the truncation of printing to fifty clonotypes?

5.  Make code work for 2 or more SVG files.

6.  Refactor to keep tokio etc. out of cellranger.

7.  Fix the close button on the upper left.

WAITING ON ICED

1.  Can't cut and paste text from the GUI window, except for the text input box.
    Looks like this is https:github.com/hecrj/iced/issues/36.

2.  Pretty, not plain.
    Enabling e.g. multicolor text is on the iced roadmap.

3.  Text in SVG objects does not show up.
    Known regression = https:github.com/hecrj/iced/issues/870.  Worked around by displaying PNG
    instead.

4.  Place the scrollbar on the left side of the scrollable window.
    Asked on zulip chat if this is possible, but did not get a response.  This is far enough
    down our list of requests that I don't want to ask further now.

5.  Make the TextInput gracefully handle long inputs.
    This is https:github.com/hecrj/iced/issues/320.  Fix targetted for 1.0.

6.  Flaky behavior scrolling large texts.
    Issue filed: https:github.com/hecrj/iced/issues/897.

7.  the wraparound problem
    Asked on zulip chat and have not yet gotten a meaningful answer, although there were some
    vague suggestions.  However this problem is related to issue 331 (horizontal scrolling) and 
    issue 307 (scrolling programmatically).

8.  Button text does not change from "Submit" to "thinking" (but worked around).
    Submitted as issue 908.  This is also bugs/button_text_update_issue.  I left a question
    on the issue so the ball is in their court.

9.  Update to the latest versions of iced and iced_aw.
    This yielded a compilation error.  Issue #25 filed on iced_aw.
    There is a possible solution there and I'm waiting on a precise specification of
    Cargo.toml entries to test it.

10. Canvas in scrollable crashes.  
    Reported as issue #924, flagged as bug.

11. Rotation of text is not yet supported, so xy plots cannot be converted to canvas, so they
    can't have tooltips.

NICE TO HAVE

1.  Add font size slider for clonotype tables.

2.  Can carriage return be used instead of pushing a button?

3.  Bold some text on the help page.
    Probably not possible at this time, could ask on zulip chat.

4.  Use native ssh calls rather than ssh commands, as this might be faster and more robust.

5.  Enable plotting after initially starting GUI.

6.  Put plots in a scrollable window.

7.  Add scale slider for plots.

8.  Make "enclone help ..." work.

9.  Make summaries viewable.

10. Can a row have one item left aligned and the second center aligned?  Apply to banner.

11. Add button to capture the entire enclone visual window.

12. Get copy button to appear right next to the graphic.

13. Clicking or tapping on a clonotype should cause that clonotype to be displayed.
    Start by reading how the canvas in the game of life example handles clicks.

14. Improve rendering of enclone TCR=1146724-1146731,1146751-1146758 PLOT=gui.  The image
    exhibits weird fluctuations in darkness.
