TO DO

1.  Improve data shown for tooltip.

2.  Trim features and duplicated crates; reduce binary size.

3.  What do we do about the truncation of printing to fifty clonotypes?

4.  Make code work for 2 or more SVG files.

5.  Fix the close button on the upper left.

6.  Eliminate the 9.2 second delay on the Mac.  This is sometimes observed, even when connected
    to the internet.  Also should we codesign enclone for the Mac?

7.  Diagnose memory leak.

8.  Use of help and cookbook and perhaps other buttons is flaky, as they reuse button stats.
    Probably should fix.

WAITING ON ICED

1.  Can't cut and paste text from the GUI window, except for the text input box.
    Looks like this is https:github.com/hecrj/iced/issues/36 and 
    https:github.com/hecrj/iced/issues/645.

2.  Pretty, not plain.
    Enabling e.g. multicolor text is on the iced roadmap.

3.  Place the scrollbar on the left side of the scrollable window.
    Asked on zulip chat if this is possible, but did not get a response.  This is far enough
    down our list of requests that I don't want to ask further now.

4.  Make the TextInput gracefully handle long inputs.
    This is https:github.com/hecrj/iced/issues/320.  Fix targetted for 1.0.

5.  Flaky behavior scrolling large texts.
    Issue filed: https:github.com/hecrj/iced/issues/897.

6.  Button text does not change from "Submit" to "thinking" (but worked around).
    Submitted as issue 908.  This is also bugs/button_text_update_issue.  I left a question
    on the issue so the ball is in their court.

7.  Canvas in scrollable crashes.  So we can't put plots in a scrollable window.
    Reported as issue #924, flagged as bug.

8.  Rotation of text is not yet supported, so xy plots cannot be converted to canvas, so they
    can't have tooltips.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NICE TO HAVE

1.  Add font size slider for clonotype tables.

2.  Can carriage return be used instead of pushing a button?

3.  Bold some text on the help page.
    Probably not possible at this time, could ask on zulip chat.

4.  Use native ssh calls rather than ssh commands, as this might be faster and more robust.

5.  Add scale slider for plots.

6.  Make "enclone help ..." work.

7.  Can a row have one item left aligned and the second center aligned?  Apply to banner.

8.  Add button to capture the entire enclone visual window.

9.  Improve rendering of enclone TCR=1146724-1146731,1146751-1146758 PLOT=gui.  The image
    exhibits weird fluctuations in darkness.

10. Profile and optimize, including on large datasets.  Addition of last_widths seemed to slow
    things down, and gzipped representation of tables is crappy because it doesn't allow access
    to individual elements without unzipping everything.
