TO DO

1.  Improve data shown for tooltip.

2.  Trim features and duplicated crates; reduce binary size.

3.  What do we do about the truncation of printing to fifty clonotypes?

4.  Make code work for 2 or more SVG files.

5.  Fix the close button on the upper left.

6.  Eliminate the 9.2 second delay on the Mac.  This is sometimes observed, even when connected
    to the internet.  Also should we codesign enclone for the Mac?

7.  Diagnose memory leak.

8.  Use of help and cookbook and perhaps other buttons is flaky, as they reuse button stats.
    Probably should fix.

WAITING ON ICED

1.  Can't cut and paste text from the GUI window, except for the text input box.
    Looks like this is https:github.com/hecrj/iced/issues/36 and 
    https:github.com/hecrj/iced/issues/645.

2.  Pretty, not plain.
    Enabling e.g. multicolor text is on the iced roadmap.

3.  Place the scrollbar on the left side of the scrollable window.
    Asked on zulip chat if this is possible, but did not get a response.  This is far enough
    down our list of requests that I don't want to ask further now.

4.  Make the TextInput gracefully handle long inputs.
    This is https:github.com/hecrj/iced/issues/320.  Fix targetted for 1.0.

5.  Flaky behavior scrolling large texts.
    Issue filed: https:github.com/hecrj/iced/issues/897.

6.  Canvas in scrollable crashes.  So we can't put plots in a scrollable window.
    Reported as issue #924, flagged as bug.

7.  Rotation of text is not yet supported, so xy plots cannot be converted to canvas, so they
    can't have tooltips.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NICE TO HAVE

1.  Add font size slider for clonotype tables.

2.  Can carriage return be used instead of pushing a button?

3.  Bold some text on the help page.
    Probably not possible at this time, could ask on zulip chat.

4.  Use native ssh calls rather than ssh commands, as this might be faster and more robust.

5.  Add scale slider for plots, and/or zooming.

6.  Make "enclone help ..." work.

7.  Improve rendering of enclone TCR=1146724-1146731,1146751-1146758 PLOT=gui.  The image
    exhibits weird fluctuations in darkness.

8.  Profile and optimize, including on large datasets.  Addition of last_widths seemed to slow
    things down, and gzipped representation of tables is crappy because it doesn't allow access
    to individual elements without unzipping everything.

9.  Possibly remove the window top bar, since the red exit button is broken anyway.  There is
    a thing platform_specific.title_hidden in iced, but it's not clear how to use it.  This seems
    to have something to do with using cfg! macros.

10. Clean up hist_uniq vectors after each del operation to avoid wasting memory.

11. Make sure layout is optimized for top/bottom balance and efficient space usage, including when 
    the window is changed in size.  An example where suboptimal space usage can be seen is
    enclone BCR=123085:123089 HONEY=out=gui,color=var,u_cell2 SPLIT_PLOT_BY_ORIGIN MIN_CELLS=5
    including as one shrinks the window vertically.

12. Make horizontal rules in scrollables less wide so they don't overlap the scrollbar, which
    seems ugly.

13. The copy image button yields low quality.  Inspection of the PNG shows that the DPI is 72,
    regardless of the value given for DPI.  Filed issue #451 for resvg crate.  Note that
    screen capture gives 144 DPI, and the screen capture images are much better.  Note that one
    can increase quality for resvg e.g.
    cargo run --release -- --width 8000 --background white ~/plot.svg ~/plot.png
    but that results in a physically much larger image, because it's still at 72 DPI.

14. Make the middle line vertically movable to change the relative window sizes.  Maybe.
    Or maybe just make both halves viewable as separate windows.
