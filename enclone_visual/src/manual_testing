MANUAL TESTING

1. enclone VIS=b
   (a) Type #1 and then manually scroll up and down for two minutes.  Should not slow down or crash.
   (b) Scroll to the bottom and make sure the last clonotype is not truncated.
   (c) Check that group number 0 and too large give errors.
   (d) Check that group number 1 is the right clonotype.
   (e) Try to cut and paste from clonotype tables [BROKEN].
   (f) Test help button.
   (g) Test that copy image button flashes and that it actually copies.
   (h) Test cookbook commands #5 and #6.
   (i) enclone BCR=1096354 MIN_CELLS=5 PLOT_BY_ISOTYPE=gui 
       check tooltip functionality
   (j) enclone BCR=123085:123089 PLOT="gui,s1->red,s2->blue" LEGEND=red,"f 123085",blue,"f 123089"
       check tooltip functionality
   (k) enclone BCR=123085 NOPRINT

2. Repeat ten times:
   (a) type enclone VIS
   (b) type #1
   (c) make sure it says "thinking" briefly and produces output
   (d) exit.

3. enclone VIS and type Help, Dismiss, Help, Dismiss, Help, Dismiss.  Do these respond instantly?

4. enclone VIS=b
   - enclone TCR=1146724-1146731,1146751-1146758 PLOT=gui
   - this is a large dataset, so the canvas is huge
   - make sure scrolling is smooth and that tooltip responds essentially instantly
