Please type bit.ly/enclone in a browser to learn more about enclone.

To use enclone visual, type in the box
(see below)\nand then push the Submit button.  Here are the things
that you can type:

• an enclone command
• a group id (number)
• a recipe tag (see cookbook)
• q to quit

The enclone visual app view is vertically divided roughly as follows, going downward:
1. command input line
2. graphics subwindow
3. clonotype subwindow.
The app remembers previous states of 1 and 2, but not 3.  There are buttons in the graphics
subwindow that allow navigation through previous commands/graphics, and which can also re-execute
a command to get the clonotypes back.  Some buttons are blank initially.  Those do nothing until
populated with something (like a down arrow, to go forward to the next state).

If you run a command, and then run a similar command after it, enclone visual may elide some
calculations from the previous command, so as to respond faster.

Some limitations of this version:
1. There is no color in the clonotype tables.
2. Cutting and pasting from clonotype tables doesn't work.
3. Long commands are hard to work with in the input box.
4. Very wide clonotype tables wrap, making them unintelligible, and
   only solvable by window resizing, and sometimes not that.
