Please type bit.ly/enclone in a browser to learn more about enclone.

To use enclone visual, type in the box (see below)\nand then push the Submit button.  
Here are the things that you can type:

• an enclone command
• a group id (number), or inclusive ranger a-b, or comma-separated list of such
• a recipe tag (see cookbook)
• q to quit

If you use the group id option, the group id is converted into a special enclone option G=id.  This option can also be used directly.

The enclone visual app view is vertically divided roughly as follows, going downward:
1. command input line
2. graphics subwindow
3. clonotype subwindow
4. separately, a summary table, which pops up if you push the Summary button.

The app remembers all of this.  There are buttons in the graphics subwindow that allow navigation 
through previous commands/graphics.  Some buttons are blank initially.  Those do nothing until 
populated with something (like a down arrow, to go forward to the next state).

If you run a command, and then run a similar command after it, enclone visual may elide some
calculations from the previous command, so as to respond faster.

If you move your mouse over a cell in a honeycomb plot, you'll see some information.  If you tap
or click on a cell, then the corresponding group will be displayed in the clonotype window.

Some limitations of this version:
1. There is no color in the clonotype tables.
2. Cutting and pasting from clonotype tables doesn't work.
3. Long commands are hard to work with in the input box.
4. Very wide clonotype tables wrap, making them unintelligible, and only solvable by window resizing, and sometimes not that.
