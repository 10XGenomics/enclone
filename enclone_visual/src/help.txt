Please type bit.ly/enclone in a browser to learn more about enclone.

To use enclone visual, type in the box (see below)\nand then push the Submit button.  
Here are the things that you can type:

• an enclone command
• a group id (number), or inclusive ranger a-b, or comma-separated list of such
• a recipe tag (see cookbook)
• q to quit

If you use the group id option, the group id is converted into a special enclone option G=id.  This option can also be used directly.

The enclone visual app view is vertically divided roughly as follows, going downward:
1. command input line
2. graphics subwindow
3. clonotype subwindow
4. separately, a summary table, which pops up if you push the Summary button.

The app remembers all of this.  There are buttons in the graphics subwindow that allow navigation 
through previous commands/graphics:  
* up button   -- go to previous state
* down button -- go to next state
* del button  -- delete current state and go back to previous one.

Some buttons are blank initially.  Those do nothing until 
populated with something (like a down arrow, to go forward to the next state).

If you run a command, and then run a similar command after it, enclone visual may elide some
calculations from the previous command, so as to respond faster.

If you move your mouse over a cell in a honeycomb plot, you'll see some information.  If you tap
or click on a cell, then the corresponding group will be displayed in the clonotype window.

Some limitations of this version:
1. There is no color in the clonotype tables.
2. Cutting and pasting from clonotype tables doesn't work.
3. Long commands are hard to work with in the input box.
