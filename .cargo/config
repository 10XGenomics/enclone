# "cargo t" exercises nearly the full test suite, except for the giant test "enclone.test"
#
# It can only be run from 10x Genomics primarily because it uses a bunch of data files that we 
# don't distribute.

t = "test --bin traceback1 --test enclone_test1 --test enclone_test2 --test enclone_test3 --test enclone_test4 --test enclone_test_peak_mem -- --nocapture"

# Note that "./test" exercises this plus a few more tests.

# "cargo tb" exercises a subset of tests
#
# "cargo tb" has to be run from the directory enclone_main, but should be runnable from any
# machine, so long as at least the medium dataset has been downloaded.
#
# Note that because it runs with "--features basic", one gets a bunch of warnings when one runs
# "cargo tb".

tb = "test --test enclone_test1 --test enclone_test2 --test enclone_test3 --test enclone_test4 --features basic -- --nocapture"
