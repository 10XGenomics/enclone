Instructions for transferring customer data to 10x genomics (for enclone support):

1. The customer-facing instructions are here
https://support.10xgenomics.com/docs/transfers.  The instructions do not explain what to do
with the typical file types customers would transfer
(especially all_contig_annotations.json) but they should just do the obvious thing, which
is to tar and gzip a directory containing these files, and proceed by analogy with the
published instructions.  They should substitute enclone@10xgenomics.com for support@10xgenomics.com.

2. There are internal-facing instructions here (only readable at 10x Genomics):
