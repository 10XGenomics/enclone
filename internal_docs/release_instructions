1. Merge in changes you want to master, and then git switch master and git pull origin master to 
   catch your local version up-to-speed.
2. Do another cargo b and cargo t to make sure things behave as expected.
3. Type "start_release" to bump the z version and trigger the release process.
   - Note one thing that this does not do: it does not generate an officially signed commit
     for README.md.
   - Note that after doing a release, Cargo.lock needs to be updated.  Could this be done 
     instead as part of the release process?
4. When the release is done, change the title of the release to beta release vX.Y.Z, download the 
   binaries, and calculate the SHA-256 checksums for the binaries and include those in the release 
   notes.
