# This is the giant clonotyping specificity test, for internal use because the datasets
# it uses are not all appropriate for public release (e.g. because we're not absolutely
# certain that they're consented for that).
#
# The argument NOPAGER is included because of a trap: if the output is typed to less, then
# it is relatively easy to think that the test succeeded, even though it failed, because you
# may not see the failure message at the end.  This can cause great confusion.
#
# Use enclone.test_details to get details on false positives.  Note that this test 
# (enclone.test) actually tests more, because it generates information for every clonotype, even 
# though that information is not printed.  We found bugs this way.
