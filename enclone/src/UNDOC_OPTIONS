This file contains enclone options that are not in the online documentation for enclone.  They are 
here for a reason, for example, maybe they are buggy, or untested, or of dubious utility, or 
intended for debugging purposes only, or only work from a 10x server, etc.

Use at your own risk, ha ha.

Optional arguments controlling printing of join events:
- SEQ: print sequences of contigs, before truncation to V..J
- ANN: print annotations of contig
- ANN0: print annotations of contig, after truncation to V..J
- PFREQ=n: show data for 1/n joins even if correct
- SHOW_BC: show barcodes
- PRINT_FAILED_JOINS: print failed join events
- FAILS_ONLY: only print failed clonotypes.

Optional arguments that control clonotype filtering:
- WHITEF: only show clonotypes that exhibit whitelist contamination
- PROTECT_BADS: don't delete putatively bad stuff
- VDUP: only show clonotypes having two chains with the same V segment
- HAVE_ONESIE: only show clonotypes including a onesie exact subclonotype

Optional arguments that control miscellaneous logging:
- DESCRIP: print sample descriptions, and also reference info
- REUSE: print barcode reuse (that might arise from index hopping)
- EXACT=n: print some data about exact subclonotype n.

Optional arguments controlling logging for alternate alleles:
- CON: print alternate consensus sequences
- CON_TRACE: tracing for CON.

Optional arguments that control the joining algorithm:
- MIN_MULT: to document
- MIN_ALT: to document
- BCJOIN: substitute an algorithm that joins by barcode identity and ignores everything
          else -- only useful for studying two datasets from the same GEM well that used
          different enrichment protocols.

Optional arguments governing input and output files:
- EXFASTA=f: dump fasta file f for V..J exact subclonotypes.

Optional arguments that control printing of individual clonotypes:
- white   = percent of sequences implicated in whitelist expansion.
- CHAIN_BRIEF: show abbreviated chain column headers
- DEBUG_TABLE_PRINTING: add print lines to help debug printing of tables.
- NOTE_SIMPLE: note if the first sequence for the chain is simple, in the sense that it exactly 
               equals the concatenation of the right-truncated V with the full J segment.

Other optional arguments:
- FORCE: make joins even if redundant
- EXP: exploratory code for exact clonotyping on
- WEAK: for EXP, print all and show weaks
- GRAPH: show logging from light-heavy graph construction
- UTR_CON: run experimental UTR consensus code
- CON_CON: run experimental constant region consensus code
- NSILENT: turn on extra logging
- RE: reannotate instead of using the annotation in the json file, useful for two purposes:
      1. If you have a json file generated by an outdated code version;
      2. You want to see the effect of changed annotation code.
- NPLAIN: reverses PLAIN
- INDELS: search for and list CDR3s from clonotypes with possible SHM indels (exploratory)
- NOPRETTY: turn off pretty trace entirely
- HEAVY_CHAIN_REUSE: look for instances of heavy chain reuse
- BINARY=filename: generate binary output file
- PROTO=filename: generate proto output file
- PROTO_METADATA=filename: pass JSON metadata file for proto generation (origin,donor)
- DUMP_INTERNAL_IDS: special option to dump the list of internal ids and exit.
- TOY: toy with phylogeny

If an argument is a nonnegative integer, it is treated as if specified by TCR= or BCR=, but 
without setting one of them.  Nonnegative integers are recognized as 10x dataset identifiers 
("sample IDs") and their location is automatically found.  Inclusive ranges l1-l2 are 
expanded out.

CELLRANGER: for use if called from cellranger -- changes failure message and prevents exit
            upon normal completion

EXT=filename:
Given output of an external clonotyping algorithm which took as inputs the pipeline outputs 
for the lenas in enclone.testdata, for each exact subclonotype found by enclone, report its 
composition in the external clonotyping, as clonotype_id[count], ...
The input file should have lines of the form:
sample barcode clonotype_id.

SUMMARY_CLEAN: if SUMMARY specified, don't show computational performance stats, so 
we can regress on output

ACCEPT_INCONSISTENT: temporary option to accept inconsistent reference/annotations and feature refs

CURRENT_REF: temp option to force CR 4.0 reference

H5_SLICE: read GEX data slice by slice rather than preloading
H5: force use of H5, even if feature_barcode_matrix.bin has been built

FORCE_EXTERNAL: do not test for internal run

STABLE_DOC: print documentation in a way that it won't change when the git version changes

LVARS entries
* entropy = for each cell, take the sum over all genes of -q/log2(q), where q is the fraction of 
  total gene UMIs in the given gene; for an exact subclonotype report the median of these values
* clust = cluster id, from analysis_csv/clustering/graphclust/clusters.csv
  (for now, has to be in that exact place; not implemented for PCELL)
* type = cell type, from analysis_csv/celltypes/celltypes.csv
  Note that it's not clear how doublets are handled.
* pe<n> = PCA equivalence class at distance ≤ n, where n is an integer: it shows the equivalence
  class on all cells in a single clonotype when two cells are called equivalent if their distance
  in PCA space is ≤ n.  This is only implemented for PER_CELL.
  This uses the file analysis_csv/pca/10_components/projection.csv.
  WARNING: this only makes sense if you have one dataset--this condition is not checked.
- npe<n> = total number of cells in this clonotype that are within PCA distance n of this cell
- ppe<n> = percent of all gex cells within PCA distance n of this cell that are in this clonotype

NOTE: pe, npe and ppe cannot be used in bounds.

IMGT: specify the IMGT reference, forces RE so slow

IMGT_FIX: make certain hardcoded fixes to the IMGT reference.

SVG: render output as svg, clonotype by clonotype.  There are problems with this:
1. Safari does not correctly render these svg files.
2. The svg files use the Menlo font, which works on a Mac but is not universally available.
3. We don't render background, so this is broken for PER_CELL.

TRACE_BARCODE: print some additional information for this particular barcode

SUMMARY_CSV: nascent option to emit some summary information as CSV output

A complex of related experimental stuff:
- BASELINE: show stats relevant to NUMI and the the following two options
- UMI_FILT_MARK: mark cells based on these stats; view with undocumented lvar "mark"
  and only viewable with PER_CELL
Do not use UMI_FILT_MARK without NUMI.

UMI_RATIO_FILT_MARK

NON_CELL_MARK (only makes sense if you run NCELL)

ECHO: echo command

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MARK_STATS: generate three statistics (assumes GEX data included):
1. number of dubious cells, where dubious means not classified as a B cell, or in a clonotype for 
   which the ratio of the top dataset cells to the runner up dataset cells is at least 10 
   (e.g. 3:0 works as does 10:1)
2. number of cells that are marked (in selected clonotypes)
3. of these, number that are "good", defined as
   - that are in a clonotype having cells from >= 2 datasets
   - and which GEX classifies as B cell
   - and which have 2 or 3 chains.

MARK_STATS2: generate four statistics (assumes GEX data included):
1. number of fake expanded clonotype cells, defined as all but one cell in clonotypes for
   which the ratio of the top dataset cells to the runner up dataset cells is at least 10
2. number of these cells that are marked by the filter (ADVANTAGE)
3. number of good expanded clonotype cells, defined as cells in clonotypes having at least 10 
   cells, called a B cell by GEX, having 2 or 3 chains, and not fake as above
2. number of these cells that are marked by the filter (DISADVANTAGE)
[The motivation for this, as distinct from MARK_STATS, is that (1) now consists of just cells in
fake expanded clonotypes, and not just all dubious cells, would could be a substantially larger
set.  This allows the analysis of the effect of a filter on fake expanded clonotypes.]
*** THIS SHOULD BE RUN WITH NGEX AND NCROSS. ***

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BI=n, where 1 <= n <= 13 (for now):
load BCR and GEX from datasets described in enclone.testdata.bcr.gex
(This only works internally where we have these datasets available.)
(BI short for "built-in".)
also BIB and BIP

PRINT_CPU: print number of cpu cycles used
PRINT_CPU_INFO: print info about cpu usage

PLOT_BY_MARK

MAX_SCORE: was public, now deprecated, do not remove

REQUIRE_UNBROKEN_OK: require that if a V reference sequence is not marked as broken, then all
its features can be computed, and exit after this test

NALL_GEX: turn off all filters except GEX filter

REPROD: accept nonproductive contigs, recompute productive, then reject nonproductive

SPLIT_COMMAND: assuming that BCR and GEX have been provided with multiple entries each, split out 
separate commands having them specified one by one, and run them, then exit

OPTIONS THAT ALLOW METRIC VALUES TO BE LOCKED

REQUIRED_FPS=n: exit(1) if the number of false positives is not n; here we define a false
positive to be a clonotype that contains cells from multiple donors.

REQUIRED_CELLS=n: exit(1) if the number of cells in clonotypes is not n

REQUIRED_CLONOTYPES=n: exit(1) if the number of clonotypes is not n

REQUIRED_DONORS=n: exit(1) if the number of donors is not n

REQUIRED_TWO_CELL_CLONOTYPES=n: exit(1) if the number of clonotypes having >= 2 cells is not n

REQUIRED_TWO_CHAIN_CLONOTYPES=n: exit(1) if the number of two chain clonotypes is not n

REQUIRED_DATASETS=n: exit(1) if the number of datasets is not n

GD_BC=x
translates into BC=x/outs/genetic_demux_results/clusters.tsv
to allow for convenient use of genetic demux results in the PD pipeline

===================================================================================================

cvars

nval      = number of validated UMIs
nnval     = number of non-validated UMIs
nival     = number of invalidated UMIs
valumis   = validated UMIs
nvalumis  = non-validated UMIs
ivalumis  = invalidated UMIs
valbcumis   = validated UMIs, preceded by barcode
nvalbcumis  = non-validated UMIs, preceded by barcode
ivalbcumis  = invalidated UMIs, preceded by barcode

All three classes of UMIs are capped at 20 UMIs.

===================================================================================================

CLONOTYPE_GROUP_NAMES=filename
* The file should be a a CSV file with that includes fields new_group_name and group_id.  This is
  confusing nomenclature, see what follows.
* The group_id should be obtained by running enclone WITHOUT grouping, so that there is exactly 
  one clonotype per group.
* The new_group_name is the name of a group (of your own concoction) that you are assigning a 
  clonotype to.
* A clonotype may not be assigned to more than one group.
* The idea is that one would run enclone once to gather information that would
  allow grouping of clonotypes.  Then run it as second time with this argument.
* The argument only does something if honeycomb plotting is used.  In that case, the honeycomb
  plot is split by group and each group is given a different (light) background color.
* Clonotypes that are not assigned to a group are not displayed.

===================================================================================================

read utilization - This is a stat generated with the SUMMARY option, in internal mode.  It is the
fraction of reads that are assigned to chains by enclone.  It has the following issues:
1. It doesn't account for reads that are lost because of capping in assembly.  Internally, we
can work around this by removing the capping on a cellranger branch.  (Done now.)
2. It would not be correct if read one was significantly longer than 28 bases, so that it could 
contribute to assembly.

NO_UNCAP_SIM: turn off uncapping simulation

===================================================================================================

HAPS_DEBUG: turn on debug mode for the HAPS option

PROFILE: turn on profiling, normally used with NOPRINT; paging is turned off because this
This won't work with paging, however you can pipe to "less -r".

===================================================================================================

ROW_FILL_VERBOSE: special option for debugging

TOP_GENES: list genes having the highest expression in the selected clonotypes, taking the median 
across all cells (only implemented if .bin file has been generated using NH5)

COMPE: COMP, plus enforce no unaccounted time (except up to 0.02 seconds)
UNACCOUNTED: show unaccounted time at each step
EVIL_EYE: print logging to facilitate diagnosis of mysterious hanging

TOY_COM: compute clonotypes, then act as toy server, which can speak to enclone_client

TOOLTIP: add tooltip text to honeycomb plots

ALIGN_JUN_ALIGN_CONSISTENCY: test to see if they give consistent results 
(run with ALIGN1 JUN_ALIGN1 PLAIN)

junction region alignment penalties accessible from the command line:
- JSCORE_MATCH
- JSCORE_MISMATCH
- JSCORE_GAP_EXTEND
- JSCORE_GAP_OPEN
- JSCORE_BITS_MULT

lvars fb<n> and fb<n>_n: for example, fb1 is the 15-base sequence of the most frequent feature
barcode, and fb1_n is the number of UMIs for that feature barcode
- only usable if there is just one dataset
- the file feature_barcode_matrix_top.bin must have been generated

SIM_MAT_PLOT=filename,v1,...,vn
generate a plot of the all-vs-all per cell cosine similarity for the variables vi

NO_BUG_REPORTS: don't automatically report bugs

SUBSAMPLE: subsample barcodes at the indicated fraction; at present this is deliberately
           randomly seeded and so nonreproducible

===================================================================================================

ALL_BC=filename,field1,...,fieldn

Dump a CSV file with fields

    dataset,barcode,field1,...,fieldn

to filename, with one line for each barcode.  All barcodes in the data files are included, whether
or not they correspond to VDJ cells.  This would correspond (at least approximately) to all
whitelisted barcodes in the raw data.

Only certain other fields are allowed:
1. feature variables, e.g. CDR3_ab, representing the UMI count
2. gex = total gene expression UMI count
3. type = the cell type
4. clust = cluster id, from analysis_csv/clustering/graphclust/clusters.csv
5. cell = vdj or gex or gex_vdj or empty.

This may also be used with VAR_DEF.

ALL_BCH: same but human readable instead of CSV

===================================================================================================

PRE_EVAL: evaluate sensitivity and specificity before calling print_clonotypes

JOIN_BASIC_H=n: use a special join heuristic as follows (for demonstration purposes only)
    same heavy chain V, same heavy chain J, 
    same heavy chain CDR3 length, 
    n% identity on nucleotides within heavy chain CDR3
This automatically invokes PRE_EVAL because otherwise it would crash.
This option is particularly slow because it forces more comparisons in the join step.
Uses very high memory.  Time and memory use increase as n is reduced.

===================================================================================================

EXTERNAL_REF: if you set this to a IMGT reference fasta file, this will compare the internally
generated donor reference to it, do some analyses, and exit

To generate the current IMGT reference within the 10x codebase, do something like this:
1. bazel build //:pd //:shimulate //:devpipes_env
2. cellranger/bazel-bin/devpipes_env.sh python cellranger/lib/bin/fetch_imgt_lib.py 
   --genome vdj_IMGT_human --species "Homo sapiens"

===================================================================================================

POST_FILTER=filename
should be CSV
dataset,barcode

Use this with PRE_EVAL.  It filters out cells that are not on that list.

===================================================================================================

PCOLS_SHOW: use this list instead of PCOLS to head the parseable output

SUPER_COMP_FILT=...: like JUN_SHARE but literally gates on junction sharing.  Note that this has
verbose logging, which really should be controlled by a separate option.
