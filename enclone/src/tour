1. Duplicated V segment.  Assembly graph has an indel bubble, 
and there are UMIs that support both branches of the bubble, probably because of barcode
exchange.  So the presence of both chains 1 and 2 is an assembly artifact, that we might 
hope to fix by improving the assembly algorithm.

2. Two clonotypes.

enclone 123085 CDR3=CAKKVHHGVVVSATPPWYFDLW

3. Same, grouped, suggests possible improvements to join heuristics.

4. Fishy foursie (see next).

5. Now we see that it's an artifact of 123085.  Could be explained by GEM containing 2 cells and 
20 gel beads.  Can't think of another explanation.  Algorithm should kill if both datasets given.
Not sure how to get rid of it if only 123085 given.  Maybe just because fishy foursie.

6. Show ability to see gene expression and antibodies.
