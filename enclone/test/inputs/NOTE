Directories version*. contain large pipeline output files.  These files will need to be
periodically updated.  This should be done by git removing the version* directory, and git
adding a new version* directory, which has updated files in it.

This is to avoid causing git to think about edits to large files.

The reason we're not storing these files using git-lfs is that git-lfs tends to do flaky
things periodically, possibly because of user error, but it makes it too fragile for a 
public repo.
