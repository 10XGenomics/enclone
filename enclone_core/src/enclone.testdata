# Some sample.  Excluded 114513 because 114840 is on the same flowcell with it, and they share
# a barcode with identical V..J, and this barcode results in an FP between 114513 and 116096.
# One can't solve the problem by adding 114840 to the test set because it behaves as if it's a
# mixture of two samples.

# At one point we excluded 140365 based on putative contamination.  That was because it overlapped
