<h1>History</h1>

<p>This page provides a selective history of what was changed in enclone and when.</p>

<p>
We show changes that affect users like new features, changes to results, and the like.  This
log starts with with initial public availability.  The complete history may be seen by cloning the 
enclone repo and typing <code>git log</code>.
</p>

<p><span style="color:red">Breaking changes are shown in red.</span></p>

<p style="border: 2px; border-style: solid; border-color: black; background-color: #FFFDD0;
padding: 8px; width: 900px; font-size: 120%">
Please be aware that our workflow when we make changes is to automatically update the GitHub
site, including all the website pages and this page too.  This happens <i>in advance</i> of 
actually making a release (which might follow in a couple days).  This means that the website
may describe features that are not yet available in a release (although they will be in the
source code that's available).  We apologize for this asynchrony!  Note however that the 
command-line help that comes with your copy of enclone will always match its behavior.</p>

Change the definition of the fields "edit" and "comp" to be based on
