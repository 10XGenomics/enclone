<span style="font-weight:bold;">plotting clonotypes</span>

enclone can create a "honeycomb" plot showing each clonotype as a cluster of dots, one per cell. 
You can see an example at <span style="color:#25bc24;">https://enclone.10xgenomics.github.io/index.html#honeycomb</span>.

enclone provides three ways to assign colors in such a plot.  We describe them in order of
precedence, i.e. color data for the first will be used if provided, etc.

The first way is to use the argument
<span style="font-weight:bold;">PLOT="filename,sample1->color1,...,samplen->colorn"</span>
which creates an svg file of the given name, and assigns the given colors to the given samples. 
Unspecified samples will be black.

The second way is to provide simply
<span style="font-weight:bold;">PLOT=filename</span>
on the command line, and then provide the <span style="font-weight:bold;">color</span> field in the CSV defined by the <span style="font-weight:bold;">META</span> option.  This
assigns a color to each dataset.

The third way is to use the simple <span style="font-weight:bold;">PLOT</span> specification, and assign a color to each barcode using
the <span style="font-weight:bold;">bc</span> field for <span style="font-weight:bold;">META</span>.

The colors should be valid colors for use in an svg file.  They can be named colors like red or
blue (see <span style="color:#25bc24;">https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/types.html#ColorKeywords</span> for a full list) or a hex
specification like #00FFFF for aqua.  The full color description for svg is at
<span style="color:#25bc24;">https://www.w3.org/TR/SVGColor12</span>.

enclone also recognizes the color abbreviations @1, ..., @6, which refer to enclone's color blind
friendly palette (see "enclone help color").

Each cell is shown as a disk having the given color, and each clonotype is shown as a cluster of
these disks, which are positioned at random.  We suggest using the <span style="font-weight:bold;">MIN_CELLS</span> option (see "enclone
help filter") so that tiny clonotypes do not dominate.  The filename argument may be "stdout". 
Note that plotting is potentially slow.

To add a legend to the graph, add the argument <span style="font-weight:bold;">LEGEND</span> to your command line.  This will give you an
auto-generated legend.  You can also customize the legend by adding an argument of the form
<span style="font-weight:bold;">LEGEND=color1,"text1",...,colorn,"textn"</span>
to the command line.
