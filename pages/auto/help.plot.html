[01mplotting clonotypes[0m

enclone can create a "honeycomb" plot showing each clonotype as a cluster of dots, one per cell. 
You can see an example at [32mhttps://github.com/10XGenomics/enclone/blob/master/README.md#honeycomb[0m.

enclone provides three ways to assign colors in such a plot.  We describe them in order of
precedence, i.e. color data for the first will be used if provided, etc.

The first way is to use the argument
[01mPLOT="filename,sample1->color1,...,samplen->colorn"[0m
which creates an svg file of the given name, and assigns the given colors to the given samples. 
Unspecified samples will be black.

The second way is to provide simply
[01mPLOT=filename[0m
on the command line, and then provide the [01mcolor[0m field in the CSV defined by the [01mMETA[0m option.  This
assigns a color to each dataset.

The third way is to use the simple [01mPLOT[0m specification, and assign a color to each barcode using
the [01mbc[0m field for [01mMETA[0m.

The colors should be valid colors for use in an svg file.  They can be named colors like red or
blue (see [32mhttps://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/types.html#ColorKeywords[0m for a full list) or a hex
specification like #00FFFF for aqua.  The full color description for svg is at
[32mhttps://www.w3.org/TR/SVGColor12[0m.

enclone also recognizes the color abbreviations @1, ..., @6, which refer to enclone's color blind
friendly palette (see "enclone help color").

Each cell is shown as a disk having the given color, and each clonotype is shown as a cluster of
these disks, which are positioned at random.  We suggest using the [01mMIN_CELLS[0m option (see "enclone
help filter") so that tiny clonotypes do not dominate.  The filename argument may be "stdout". 
Note that plotting is potentially slow.

To add a legend to the graph, add the argument [01mLEGEND[0m to your command line.  This will give you an
auto-generated legend.  You can also customize the legend by adding an argument of the form
[01mLEGEND=color1,"text1",...,colorn,"textn"[0m
to the command line.
