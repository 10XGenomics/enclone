│CDR3                │  The terms CDR3 and junction are commonly mistaken and often used           │
│                    │  interchangeably.  In enclone's nomenclature, "CDR3" actually refers to the │

│                    │  respectively).                                                             │

[01m[31m○[0m The exact requirements for being in the same exact subclonotype are that cells:
• have the same number of productive contigs identified
• that these have identical bases within V..J
• that they are assigned the same constant region reference sequences
• and that the difference between the V stop and the C start is the same
  (noting that this difference is nearly always zero).
Note that we allow mutations within the 5'-UTR and constant regions.

[01mconventions[0m

• When we refer to "V segments", we always include the leader segment.
• Zero or one?  We number exact subclonotypes as 1, 2, ... and likewise with
chains within a clonotype, however DNA and amino-acid positions are numbered starting at zero.
