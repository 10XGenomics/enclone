<h1><span style="color:rgb(120,123,175);font-weight:900">enclone</span> installation troubleshooting</h1>

<p>The purpose of this page is to provide guidance in case the <span style="color:rgb(120,123,175);font-weight:900">enclone</span> installation fails.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Case 1: the <code>curl</code> command is not found</h2>

<p>The command <code>curl</code> is not installed on your computer.  In that case,
you should have the command <code>wget</code>, and can use that instead.  To do so, run the
following command:
<pre style="margin-top:3px; margin-bottom:3px"><code>wget -nv bit.ly/enclone_install -O - | sh -s <span style="color:red; font-weight: bold">SIZE</span></code></pre>
where <code><span style="color:red; font-weight: bold">SIZE</span></code>
is as described on the main <span style="color:rgb(120,123,175);font-weight:900">enclone</span> page.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Case 2: download is so slow that it doesn't finish</h2>

<p>In this case, please use the <code>SMALL</code> option, and if you
still have difficulty, please contact us.  We might be able to reduce the download size.  Please
let us know your typical download rate (MB/sec) and any other relevant information about the
characteristics of your connection.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Case 4: installation seems to succeed but <code>enclone</code> is killed</h2>

<p>In this case, when you type <code>enclone</code> from the command line, you'll get a message
about it being killed.  This has happened to some Mac users.  In one case we observed that the
problem went away if the executable was deleted
<br><code>rm ~/bin/enclone</code>
<br>and then the installation line was repeated.  We are actively looking for a robust solution.
Please let us know if you are stuck.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Case 5: installation seems to succeed but you get a message about 
<code>GLIBC</code> not found</h2>

<p>This probably means that you are using a Linux machine which has a very old version of the
operating system on it.  Your options are:
<ol>
<li>Get the operating system on the machine upgraded.</li>
<li>Use a different machine.</li>
<li>Install <span style="color:rgb(120,123,175);font-weight:900">enclone</span> from source code.  This is not necessarily difficult.</li>
</ol>
</p>
