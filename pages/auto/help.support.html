[31menclone (beta) is provided as an open-source tool for use by the community.  Although we cannot
guarantee full support for the software, please email us at enclone@10xgenomics.com if you have
problems, questions or comments (see below).  If you prefer you may submit a GitHub issue.[0m

[38;5;12mPlease note that syntax and features in enclone will change over time.  See[0m
[32mhttps://github.com/10XGenomics/enclone/blob/master/HISTORY.md[0m [38;5;12mfor the history of what was changed[0m
[38;5;12mand when.  We will try not to break[0m [38;5;12mthings, but when we first introduce a feature, it may[0m
[38;5;12mnot be just right, and we may have to to perturb it later.[0m

[01mCritical things we want to hear from you[0m

1. If you have trouble understanding the documentation.

2. If enclone crashes.  We always need to see the output you got.  Often we will need data to
reproduce the problem.  Please also send this version information:
0.1.3 : dj/23 : a65fc0a+ : 2020-04-19 : release : linux : x86_64.

3. If you're sure that enclone made a mistake.  Usually an actionable mistake is exhibited via a
single clonotype or two, along with your explanation as to why it's wrong!  And we may need the
enclone input files to reproduce the problem.

4. Your ideas about how to make enclone better.

[01mThings where we may have trouble[0m

1. If you can't get your terminal window to work or need help working from the command line. 
Please tell us, but probably you'll need help from someone who can interact with you on site.

2. If you get different results by two methods or observe suspicious statistics.  Feel free to
tell us, but we are much more likely to be able to respond if you have specific data as in point 3
above.

3. Details about the algorithms.  We can answer some questions but may need to point you to the
source code to read yourself.

4. If for whatever reason, we get stuck.  We may not be able to fix every problem, even if it's
our fault.  And sometimes the right solution will take time.  We'll do our best!

[31mPlease communicate with us by writing to[0m [01m[31menclone@10xgenomics.com.[0m

We use only this email address for enclone questions.  Support from 10x Genomics for enclone needs
to go through this point of access (or the next one).

If you are GitHub-savvy, we also welcome GitHub issues if applicable and you prefer that route. 
If you can make the enclone code better, go for it!  Make sure the internal tests are successful,
submit a pull request, and if we can use your code (no guarantees), we'll add you as an author on
the site.
