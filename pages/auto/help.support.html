<span style="color:#c23621;">enclone (beta) is provided as an open-source tool for use by the community.  Although we cannot
guarantee full support for the software, please email us at enclone@10xgenomics.com if you have
problems, questions or comments (see below).  If you prefer you may submit a GitHub issue.</span>

<span style="color:#5833ff;">Please note that syntax and features in enclone will change over time.  See</span>
<span style="color:#25bc24;">https://github.com/10XGenomics/enclone/blob/master/HISTORY.md</span> <span style="color:#5833ff;">for the history of what was changed</span>
<span style="color:#5833ff;">and when.  We will try not to break</span> <span style="color:#5833ff;">things, but when we first introduce a feature, it may</span>
<span style="color:#5833ff;">not be just right, and we may have to to perturb it later.</span>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Critical things we want to hear from you</span>

1. If you have trouble understanding the documentation.

2. If enclone crashes.  We always need to see the output you got.  Often we will need data to
reproduce the problem.  Please also send this version information:
(your enclone version information will be printed here).

3. If you're sure that enclone made a mistake.  Usually an actionable mistake is exhibited via a
single clonotype or two, along with your explanation as to why it's wrong!  And we may need the
enclone input files to reproduce the problem.

4. Your ideas about how to make enclone better.

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Things where we may have trouble</span>

1. If you can't get your terminal window to work or need help working from the command line. 
Please tell us, but probably you'll need help from someone who can interact with you on site.

2. If you get different results by two methods or observe suspicious statistics.  Feel free to
tell us, but we are much more likely to be able to respond if you have specific data as in point 3
above.

3. Details about the algorithms.  We can answer some questions but may need to point you to the
source code to read yourself.

4. If for whatever reason, we get stuck.  We may not be able to fix every problem, even if it's
our fault.  And sometimes the right solution will take time.  We'll do our best!

<span style="color:#c23621;">Please communicate with us by writing to</span> <span style="color:#c23621;font-weight:bold;">enclone@10xgenomics.com.</span>

We use only this email address for enclone questions.  Support from 10x Genomics for enclone needs
to go through this point of access (or the next one).

If you are GitHub-savvy, we also welcome GitHub issues if applicable and you prefer that route. 
If you can make the enclone code better, go for it!  Make sure the internal tests are successful,
submit a pull request, and if we can use your code (no guarantees), we'll add you as an author on
the site.
