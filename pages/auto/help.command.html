[01m1. Order of processing[0m

â€¢ Before processing its command line, enclone first checks for environment
variables of the form [01mENCLONE_<x>[0m.  These are converted into command-line arguments.  You can set
any command-line argument this way.  The reason why you might want to use this feature is if you
find yourself using the same command-line option over and over, and it is more convenient to set
it once as an environment variable.
â€¢ For example, setting the environment variable [01mENCLONE_PRE[0m to [01m/Users/me/enclone_data[0m is
equivalent to providing the command-line argument [01mPRE=/Users/me/enclone_data[0m.
â€¢ After checking environment variables, arguments on the command line are read from left to right;
if an argument name is repeated, only the rightmost value is used, except as noted specifically in
the documentation.

[01m2. Color[0m

[01m[38;5;25me[0m[01m[38;5;166mn[0m[38;5;178mc[0m[01m[38;5;75ml[0m[01m[38;5;175mo[0m[38;5;36mn[0m[01m[38;5;166me[0m uses ANSI escape codes for color and bolding, frivolously, for emphasis, and more
importantly for amino acids, to represent different codons.  This is done automatically but you
can turn it off....

[01m[31mPLEASE READ THIS:[0m

You can turn off escape codes by adding [01mPLAIN[0m to any command.  Use this if you want to peruse
output using a text editor which does not grok the escape codes.  However some things will not
make sense without color.

[01m3. Paging[0m

â€¢ enclone automatically pipes its output to [01mless -R -F -X[0m.
â€¢ The effect of this will be that you'll see only the first screen of output.  You can then use
the spacebar to go forward, b to go backward, and q to quit.  The [01m-R[0m option causes escape
characters to be correctly displayed, the [01m-F[0m option causes an automatic exit if output fits on a
single screen, and the [01m-X[0m option prevents output from being sent to the "alternate screen" under
certain platform/version combinations.
â€¢ Type [01mman less[0m if you need more information.
â€¢ If for whatever reason you need to turn off output paging, add the argument [01mNOPAGER[0m to the
enclone command.
