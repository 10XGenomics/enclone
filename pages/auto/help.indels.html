<span style="font-weight:bold;">handling of insertions and deletions</span>

enclone can recognize and display a single insertion or deletion in a contig relative to the
reference, so long as its length is divisible by three, is relatively short, and occurs within the
V segment, not too close to its right end.

These indels could be germline, however most such events are already captured in a reference
sequence.  Currently the donor reference code in enclone does not recognize indels.

SHM deletions are rare, and SHM insertions are even more rare.

Deletions are displayed using hyphens (-).  If you use the <span style="font-weight:bold;">var</span> option for <span style="font-weight:bold;">cvars</span>, the hyphens will
be displayed in base space, where they are initially observed.  For the <span style="font-weight:bold;">AMINO</span> option, the deletion
is first shifted by up to two bases, so that the deletion starts at a base position that is
divisible by three.  Then the deleted amino acids are shown as hyphens.

Insertions are shown only in amino acid space, in a special per-chain column called <span style="font-weight:bold;">notes</span> that
appears if there is an insertion.  Colored amino acids are shown for the insertion, and the
position of the insertion is shown.  The notation e.g.
ins = TFT at 46
means that TFT is inserted after the first 46 amino acids.  Since the first amino acid (which is a
start codon) is numbered 0, the insertion actually occurs after the amino acid numbered 45.
