<p>This is a guide for <span style="color:rgb(120,123,175);font-weight:900">enclone</span> developers, both inside and outside 10x Genomics.</p>

<p style="border: 2px; border-style: solid; border-color: black; padding: 8px;">
There is no reason to read this, unless you want to experimentally modify <span style="color:rgb(120,123,175);font-weight:900">enclone</span>, or are 
curious.  We distribute pre-built binaries for <span style="color:rgb(120,123,175);font-weight:900">enclone</span>, and that's all you need if you just
want to run the existing code.
</p>

<hr><h2>The <span style="color:rgb(120,123,175);font-weight:900">enclone</span> components</h2>

<p><span style="color:rgb(120,123,175);font-weight:900">enclone</span> has the following software and data components:
<ul>

<li>
A GitHub repo
<a href="https://github.com/10XGenomics/enclone">
https://github.com/10XGenomics/enclone
</a>
that is maintained by 10x Genomics.  Contributions are welcome.  The software is licensed freely, 
however only for use with 10x Genomics data.  Please read the 
<a href="../../LICENSE.txt">license</a>.
</li>

<li>
A web site <a href="https://10xgenomics.github.io/enclone">
https://10xgenomics.github.io/enclone
</a>
that is built automatically by code in the above repo.
</li>

<li>
A separate GitHub repo
<a href="https://github.com/10XGenomics/enclone-data">
https://10xgenomics.github.io/enclone-data
</a>
that contains a small number of datasets.  If you build <span style="color:rgb(120,123,175);font-weight:900">enclone</span>, this is automatically
downloaded as part of the build process.  If you install <span style="color:rgb(120,123,175);font-weight:900">enclone</span>, this is downloaded into
a separate location (<code>~/enclone</code>), unless you 
choose the <code>small</code> option, in which case you get only a subset of it.  The reason
for having a separate repo for data is to keep the <span style="color:rgb(120,123,175);font-weight:900">enclone</span> repo itself small.
</li>

<li>
A larger collection of datasets that are downloaded if you install with the <code>large</code>
option.
</li>

<li>
A still larger collection of datasets that are internal to 10x Genomics and not publicly
available.  These datasets are kept internal because of consent restrictions, or because the
datasets were generated as part of experiments using unpublished protocols.  Some of these
datasets are used in the <span style="color:rgb(120,123,175);font-weight:900">enclone</span> test suite, although there is a shorter test suite that runs
using only public data.  These are on disk and mirrored to solid-state disk (super fast 
but less reliable).  We set <code>PRE</code> to that location.  The full dataset is not backed up, 
however there is a catalog <code>enclone/src/enclone.testlist.all</code> that would facilitate 
reconstruction in the event of loss.  Over time, we gradually enlarge the collection.  There is a 
program <code>import_data</code> that copies a given dataset.  Note that someone outside 
10x Genomics could use a similar system to enable fast access to data.
</li>

</ul>

<hr><h2>Software architecture</h2>

<p><span style="color:rgb(120,123,175);font-weight:900">enclone</span> is written in Rust.</p>

<p>We used Rust because the language makes it extremely easy to use Rust code written by
other people, because Rust has its own build system, and because it is fast and safe.</p>

<p>Technical details.  The repo is itself a Rust workspace, with a half dozen or so
subdirectories that comprise Rust crates.  Each of these crates has its own 
<code>Cargo.toml</code> file.  Modification of dependency
versions in these files files is done by modifying a file <code>master.toml</code> at the
top level,
and then typing <code>sync_to_master</code>, which invokes a program (part of the repo) to
sync each <code>Cargo.toml</code> to <code>master.toml</code>.

<hr><h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<p><span style="color:rgb(120,123,175);font-weight:900">enclone</span> can be built and run on an x86-64 Linux server or a Mac, although we have not
tested on a Mac with an M1 processor.</p>

<p>The following software are needed to build and test <span style="color:rgb(120,123,175);font-weight:900">enclone</span>:

<ul>

<li><code>Rust</code>.  Detailed instructions on how to install Rust
can be found <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install" rel="nofollow">here</a>. You can 
confirm that you have successfully installed the Rust compiler by running 
<code>rustc --version</code>.</li>

<li><code>cargo-license</code>.  Probably this is needed only for internal use.  You can install 
it using
<code>cargo install cargo-license</code>, assuming that you have already installed Rust.</li>

<li><code>cargo-sweep</code>.  Install via <code>cargo install cargo-sweep</code>.</li>

<li>standard utilities, including <code>git</code>, <code>curl</code> and <code>wget</code>.</li>

</ul>

<hr><h2>Building <span style="color:rgb(120,123,175);font-weight:900">enclone</span></h2>

<ol>

<li>Follow the installation instructions on the main page to install <span style="color:rgb(120,123,175);font-weight:900">enclone</span>, using the
medium or large options.  This is not needed for developers at 10x Genomics.
Doing this downloads data, which you will want for experimentation and testing.</li>

<li>
Go to a directory where you want to put the <span style="color:rgb(120,123,175);font-weight:900">enclone</span> code, and
<p>clone the <code>enclone</code> repository using
<pre><code>git clone git@github.com:10XGenomics/enclone.git</code></pre>
If you have a very slow internet connection, you might wish to download only the current version
(and not the history) using
<pre><code>git clone --depth=1 git@github.com:10XGenomics/enclone.git</code></pre>
</li>

<li>Type <code>cd enclone</code> and then <code>./build</code>.  Depending on your computer, this
will take roughly 5-10 minutes.  Subsequent invocations (after code changes) will be much 
faster.  You can also run <code>cargo b</code>, which is faster, but omits some steps.</li>

<li>Add the full path of <code>enclone/target/debug</code> to your <code>PATH</code>, and 
make sure this comes <i>before</i> <code>~/bin</code>, which was where the precompiled
version of <span style="color:rgb(120,123,175);font-weight:900">enclone</span> was downloaded to by the install command.  You may need to close and reopen
your terminal window to get the change to <code>PATH</code> to take effect.</li>

<li>Now when you type <span style="color:rgb(120,123,175);font-weight:900">enclone</span>, you'll get the version you just compiled.</li>

</ol>

<hr><h2>Testing <span style="color:rgb(120,123,175);font-weight:900">enclone</span></h2>

<p><span style="color:rgb(120,123,175);font-weight:900">enclone</span> has an extensive test suite. It has hundreds of tests.  Most but not all of the
tests can be run by anyone; the remainder use datasets that are internal to 10x Genomics.
(See earlier explanation.)</p>

<p>
To run the main tests, type:
<ul>
<li>[external users] <code>./testx</code></li>
<li>[internal users] <code>./test</code></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
There is also a very large test, which can only be run internally, which one runs by
<code>./enclone/enclone.test</code>.
</p>

<p>Pull requests trigger <code>./testx</code> (via GitHub Actions) and the very large test
(via Jenkins).  Note that the internal main test includes tests that are not tested as
part of this.</p>

<p>To better understand the testing machinery, please refer to the following files:
<ul>
<li> <code>enclone_core/src/testlist.rs</code></li>
<li> <code>enclone_main/tests/enclone_test*.rs</code></li>
<li> <code>test</code> and <code>testx</code></li>
<li> <code>.cargo/config</code></li>
<li> <code>enclone/enclone.test</code></li>
<li> <code>.github/workflows/test.yaml</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The standard test battery includes a speed test, but there is some additional testing
given by <code>./speed</code>.  However we don't routinely test this because it is too 
subject to server load.  It also only runs at 10x Genomics.</p>

<p>There are miscellaneous gnarly issues that we have not automated testing for:

<pre>
1. The code for NOPAGER accidentally broke at one point and we
   don't want that to recur.  Some test cases that could be verified:
   enclone BCR=...
   enclone BCR=... NOPAGER
   enclone help all
   enclone help all NOPAGER
   enclone help faq
   enclone help faq NOPAGER.
   This seems to require manual testing.

2. In OS X Catalina, in full screen mode, at one point enclone appeared to have no output,
   because the output was going to the alternate screen.  This seems to require manual testing.

3. We allow paths that start with ~ or ~user_name, but do not have automated testing for this.

<hr><h2>Profiling <span style="color:rgb(120,123,175);font-weight:900">enclone</span></h2>

<p><span style="color:rgb(120,123,175);font-weight:900">enclone</span> provides a few built-in mechanisms for profiling:</p>
<ol>

<li>Add the argument <code>COMP</code> to your command.  This yields a summary of wall-clock
time by code section, and also tracks peak memory usage.  There is also a version
<code>COMP2</code> that prints a bit more.  Run this with <code>NOPAGER</code> if you want
to see the lines printed as they happen.</li>

<li>Add the argument <code>PROFILE</code> to your command.  This yields a list of tracebacks
based on random interrupts.  These tracebacks are manicured and each is shown with its
multiplicity.  When this option is used, the internal paging mechanism in <span style="color:rgb(120,123,175);font-weight:900">enclone</span> is turned
off, and you may wish to pipe the output to <code>less -r</code>.</li>

<li>Add the argument <code>CTRLC</code> to your command.  Then upon CTRL-C, execution will
be stopped and a traceback printed.  In general this is only useful if your code seems to
be extremely slow or perhaps is stuck in an infinite loop.</li>

</ol>
<p>It is usually convenient to add the argument <code>NOPRINT</code> when using these profiling
options, so as to suppress other output.</p>

<! â€“â€“ â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“ -->

<hr><h2>What could go wrong?</h2>

<p>If the code crashes, you should get a clean traceback.  If this happens on the distributed
version of <span style="color:rgb(120,123,175);font-weight:900">enclone</span> or the master version, that's a bug that should be reported.</p>

<p>If you run out of disk space while building, you may get weird error messages from the linker,
in which case you should fix your disk space problem.  You might also need to
<code>cargo clean</code>.</p>

<p>Very rarely, you'll get weird error messages from the linker, with no apparent reason.
(We've seen this happen once.)  If this happens, <code>cargo clean</code> should fix the
problem.</p>

<hr><h2>Editing the <span style="color:rgb(120,123,175);font-weight:900">enclone</span> web site</h2>

<p>This is done by editing the files in the subdirectory <code>pages</code>, and never by
editing <code>.html</code> files directly.  All the <code>.html</code> files are 
auto-generated.</p>

<p>There is a script <code>./local_view</code> that copies the site to 
your <code>public_html</code> directory so that it can be previewed.</p>

<hr><h2>Making a release (internal)</h2>

<p>If the release warrants announcement, edit <code>pages/history.html.src</code> to note the
relevant changes.</p>

<p>Run <code>./test</code> on a branch if you're going to release it.  Issue a pull request,
wait for the tests there to pass, then merge to master.</p>

<p>Trigger the release using the program <code>start_release</code>, which is part
of the repo.  GitHub Actions then goes to work, and something like twenty minutes later, a new
release appears.</p>
