These options define lead variables, which correspond to columns that appear once in each
clonotype, on the left side, and have one entry for each exact subclonotype row.

Lead variables are specified using [01mLVARS=x1,...,xn[0m where each xi is one of:

│cred           │  Short for credibility.  It is a measure of the extent to which cells      │

│               │  B cells.  (Or similarly for T cells.)  For the actual definition, let n   │
│               │  be the number of VDJ cells that are also GEX cells.  For a given cell,    │
│               │  find the n GEX cells that are closest to it in PCA space, and report the  │
│               │  percent of those that are also VDJ cells.  For multiple datasets, it would│
│               │  be better to "aggr" the data, however that is not currently supported     │
│               │  The computation is also inefficient, so let us know if it's causing       │
│               │  problems for you.  And cred makes much better sense for samples that      │
│               │  consist of mixed cell types, rather than consisting of pure B or T cells. │

For gene expression and feature barcode stats, such data must be provided as input to enclone.

● Example: IG.*_g matches all genes that begin with IG.  The regular expression must be in the
alphabet A-Za-z0-9+_-.[]()|* and is only interpreted as a regular expression if it contains a
character in []()|*.  See "enclone help filter" for more information about regular expressions.

[47m [0m Some explanation is required.  If you use enclone without certain options, you get the "visual"
[47m [0m column.
[47m [0m • Add the option [01mPER_CELL[0m (see "enclone help display") and then you get visual output with extra
[47m [0m lines for each cell within an exact subclonotype, and each of those extra lines is described by
[47m [0m the "visual (one cell)" column.
[47m [0m • If you generate parseable output (see "enclone help parseable"), then you get the "parseable"
[47m [0m column for that output, unless you specify [01mPCELL[0m, and then you get the last column.
[47m [0m • For the forms with μ and Σ, the Greek letters are only used in column headings for visual output
[47m [0m (to save space), and optionally, in names of fields on the command line.
[47m [0m [32m▶[0m If you try out these features, you'll see exactly what happens! [32m◀[0m

[38;5;12m●[0m Similar to the above but simpler: n_gex is just a count of cells, visual (one cell) shows 0 or
1, n_gex_cell is defined for parseable (one cell), and the x_mean etc. forms do not apply.

The default is [01mdatasets,n[0m, except that datasets is suppressed if there is only one dataset.

[01mLVARSP=x1,...,xn[0m is like [01mLVARS[0m but appends to the list.
