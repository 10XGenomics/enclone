<h1>enclone heuristics</h1>

<p>This page is a start in describing the heuristics that <span style="color:rgb(120,123,175);font-weight:900">enclone</span> uses.  It will be gradually
expanded.  See also <a href="../../pages/auto/help.how.html">enclone help how</a>.  The content here
is geeky and technical.
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>UMI filtering.</b>  <span style="color:rgb(120,123,175);font-weight:900">enclone</span> filters out B cells having low UMI counts, relative to a baseline
that is determined for each dataset, according to a
heuristic described here, unless the argument <code>NUMI</code> is supplied, to turn off that
filter.</code>

<p>The motivation for this filter is to mitigate illusory clonotype expansions arising from
fragmentation of plasma cells or other physical processes (not all fully understood).  These
processes all result in "cells" having low UMI counts, many of which do not correspond to intact 
real cells.  Illusory clonotype expansions are generally infrequent, but occasionally cluster
in individual datasets.</p>

<p>Nomenclature: for any cell, find the maximum UMI count for its zero or more heavy chains,
and the maximum for its light chains.  The sum of these two maxima is 
denoted <code>umitot</code>.</p>

<p>The algorithm for this filter first establishes a baseline for the expected value of 
<code>umitot</code>, for each dataset taken individually.  To do this, all clonotypes having 
exactly one cell and exactly one heavy and light chain each are examined.  If there are less than 
<code>20</code> such cells, the filter is not applied to cells in that dataset.  Otherwise,
let <code>n_50%</code> denote the median of the <code>umitot</code> values for the dataset, and let
<code>n_10%</code> the 10th percentile.  Let
<pre><code>umin = min( n_10%, n_50% - 4 * sqrt(n_50%) )</code>.</pre>
This is the baseline <i>low</i> value for <code>umitot</code>.  The reason for having the second
part of the <code>min</code> is to prevent filtering in cases where UMI counts are sufficiently 
low that poisson variability could cause a real cell to appear fake.</p>

<p>Next we scan each clonotype having at least two cells, and delete every cell having 
<code>umitot < umin</code>, with the following qualifications:  
<ul>
<li>Let <code>k</code> be the number of cells to be deleted in clonotype having <code>n</code>
cells.  Then we require that for a binomial distribution having <code>p = 0.1</code>, the 
probability of observing <code>k</code> or more events in a sample of size <code>n</code> is 
less then <code>0.01</code>.  The more cells are flagged in a clonotype, the more likely this
test is satisfied, which is the point of the test.
</li>
<li>If <i>every</i> cell in a clonotype would be deleted, then we find its exact subclonotype 
having the highest sum for <code>umitot</code>, summing across its cells.  Then we protect from
deletion the cell in this exact subclonotype having the highest <code>umitot</code> value.  We 
do this because in general even if a clonotype expansion did not occur, there was probably at
least a single <i>bona fide</i> cell that gave rise to it.
</li>
</ul>

A better test could probably be devised that started from the expected distribution of UMI counts.
The test would trigger based on the number and improbability of low UMI counts.  The current test 
only considers the number of counts that fall below a threshold, and not their particular values.

<p>This UMI filter is carried out before most of the other filters.</p>

<hr>

<p><b>UMI ratio filtering.</b>  <span style="color:rgb(120,123,175);font-weight:900">enclone</span> filters out B cells having low UMI counts, relative to
other UMI counts in a given clonotype, according to a 
heuristic described here, unless the argument <code>NUMI_RATIO</code> is supplied, to turn off that
filter.</code>

<p>First we mark a cell for possible deletion, if the VDJ UMI count for some chain of some other 
cell is at least 500 times greater than the total VDJ UMI count for the given cell.</p>

<p>Then we scan each clonotype having at least two cells, and delete every cell marked as above,
with the following qualification.  
Let <code>k</code> be the number of cells to be deleted in clonotype having <code>n</code>
cells.  Then we require that for a binomial distribution having <code>p = 0.1</code>, the 
probability of observing <code>k</code> or more events in a sample of size <code>n</code> is 
less then <code>0.01</code>.</p>
