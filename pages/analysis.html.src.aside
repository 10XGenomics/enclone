<h1>Amino acid analysis</h1>

<p>This page provides some preliminary material on amino acid analysis for BCR, under
development now.</p>

<p>For every clonotype, and for every chain in that clonotype, and for every position in that
chain, one may define in multiple ways a <b>peer group</b> of amino acids, which is a frequency
distribution across the twenty standard amino acids.</p>

<p>Such a distribution may then be used to determine if an amino acid in a given exact
subclonotype is unusual in some fashion.  We will add functions around this later.</p>

<p>Initially we provide a single choice for peer group: for a given position in
FWR1..FWR3 (inclusive), it is the observed frequency, for IMGT mammalian reference sequences,
of the amino acid, for the given chain type, for the given feature (e.g. FWR1 or CDR2), and 
for the given feature length (as defined by the clonotype).  We call this peer group
"mammalian-fixed-length" or "MFL" for short.  Reference sequences that appear defective are
excluded.  Typically these appear truncated or frameshifted.</p>

<p>Our motivation for using fixed lengths is that multiple alignment across different lengths
appears in some cases to involve arbitrary choices, that may not be biologically meaningful.</p>

<p>The amino acid peer groups may be outputted to a parseable file using the argument
<code>PEER_GROUP=filename</code>, with structure like this:
<pre>
group,clonotype,chain,pos,amino_acid,count
...
12,1,2,35,G,902
12,1,2,35,E,9
12,1,2,35,D,6
12,1,2,35,V,3
12,1,2,35,W,2
12,1,2,35,R,2
12,1,2,35,A,2
...
</pre>
Positions are zero-based.  Please be aware that the file is verbose.
</p>

<p>
You can set <code>PEER_GROUP=stdout</code> if you want to see the peer group information interlaced
with clonotypes.
</p>

<p>If you prefer a human-readable file, you can specify the additional argument 
<code>PG_READABLE</code>, yielding output like this:
<pre>
group,clonotype,chain,pos,distribution
..
12,1,2,35,G=902:E=9:D=6:V=3:W=2:R=2:A=2
...
</pre>
<p>

<p>If we allow alternate distributions in the future, and you wanted the mammalian-fixed-length
distribution, you could specify <code>PG_DIST=MFL</code>, but for now this is the only choice
and the default!</p>

<hr>

<p>
You can choose to color amino acids according to their frequency in their peer group, by specifying
a command line argument of the form <code>COLOR=peer.p</code> where <code>p</code>
is a decimal number (at most <code>100</code>), representing a percentage.  For example, one
could have <code>COLOR=peer.1</code>, which would cause amino acids having general frequency 
zero to be colored red, those having general frequency
<code>â‰¤ 1%</code> to be colored light blue, and all others colored black.
