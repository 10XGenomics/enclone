<h1>Setting your path for enclone</h1>

This page explains how to edit your shell initialization file to add <code>~/bin</code> to 
the beginning of your
<code>PATH</code>.  This will work in both Linux and Mac environments.  If you are using a 
Windows computer, it will work if you use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) or are using Linux
through dual boot.

<br><br>

<b>1. Why is this necessary?</b>

<br><br>

If you do this, then every time you want to run enclone, you'll type <code>enclone</code>.
Otherwise you'll have to type <code>~/bin/enclone</code> every time, and that's inconvenient.

<br><br>

<b>2. Are these instructions universal?</b>

<br><br>

Not exactly.  They only work if you're running the <code>bash</code> shell.  To determine if this
is the case, type <code>echo $SHELL</code>.  If the answer is <code>/bin/bash</code> or some
other string that ends with <code>/bash</code>, then you
are.  Otherwise, the instructions on this page will not work.  If you're stuck, let us know
at <a href="mailto:enclone@10xgenomics.com">enclone@10xgenomics.com</a>,
and we'll add further instructions.

<br><br>

<b>3. Now type exactly this.  You only need to do it once, as it will persist "forever".</b>

<pre style="margin-top: 25px"><code>test -r ~/.bash_profile && echo 'PATH=~/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bash_profile || echo 'PATH=~/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.profile</code></pre>

<p style="margin-top: 25px">This will put <code>~/bin</code> at the beginning of your path.  It 
is complicated because some versions of Linux use the file <code>.bash_profile</code>, and some 
use <code>.profile</code>.</p>

To get this to take effect, close and reopen all your windows in which you'll be rerunning enclone.

<br><br>

<b>4. Let us know if this doesn't work.</b>

<br><br>

It is conceivable that the instructions are not configured correctly for all computers.

<br><br>

<b>5. Otherwise, carry on with enclone: you're all set!</b>
