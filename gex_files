Here we spec the GEX file requirements.  This is complicated by differences between the 
customer (CS) and internal (PD) pipeline outs file structures and the need for backward 
compatibility.

These requirements are likely to change over time.

Given a GEX path p, enclone will look for these files in p, if p ends with outs, and if not, 
first p/outs, then p.

For internal runs, if the GEX path p does not exist, and (after removing PRE), p is an integer, 
then we assume it is an internal identifier and look for it in the internal pipeline outputs.

If the NH5 option is specified to enclone, it will write out a file feature_barcode_matrix.bin to 
this same directory (p or p/outs, as above), provided that feature_barcode_matrix.bin does not 
already exist.  Subsequently, this file will be used for input whether or not NH5 is specified.
