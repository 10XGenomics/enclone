Here we spec the GEX file requirements.  This is complicated by differences between the customer (CS) 
and internal (PD) pipeline outs file structures and by the need for backward compatibility.

These requirements may change over time.

CS                                            PD
metrics_summary.csv                           metrics_summary_csv.csv
raw_feature_bc_matrix.h5                      raw_feature_bc_matrix.h5 *
analysis/clustering/graphclust/clusters.csv   analysis_csv/clustering/graphclust/clusters.csv
analysis/pca/10_components/projection.csv     analysis_csv/pca/10_components/projection.csv
(not present)                                 analysis_csv/clustering/graphclust/celltypes/celltypes.csv **

*:  named raw_gene_bc_matrices_h5.h5 in older pipeline versions
**: not present in older pipeline versions

Given a GEX path p, enclone will look for these files in p, if p ends with outs, and p/outs, if p does
not end with /outs.
