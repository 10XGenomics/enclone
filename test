# Run cargo t and another test which it's not clear how to encapsulate within cargo t.  This
# also does some tidying and reports time used.  Note that the effect of cargo t is defined 
# by .cargo/config.
#
# This prints two times, which need to be added.  Not clear how to automatically do this.
#
# Note that .github/workflows/test.yaml does not test everything that is tested here.
#
# enclone/enclone.test is a much longer test that is not included here and can only be run at 10x.
#
# See also README.
