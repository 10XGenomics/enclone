# Cautionary note.  We set package versions in enclone_versions, but it's not clear that
# this is a sound practice, particularly in the case where a crate outside the enclone repo
# depends on a crate in the enclone repo.  Such an external crate sees "*" and it's not clear
# what is done with that.

# We attempted to speed up loading on the Mac using zld,
# https://github.com/michaeleisel/zld.  First we downloaded the current release at
# https://github.com/michaeleisel/zld/releases/tag/1.3.2, and then added these lines
# (without the #) to .cargo/config:
# [target.x86_64-apple-darwin]
# rustflags = ["-C", "link-arg=-fuse-ld=/Users/david.jaffe/bin/zld"]
# To get this to work, we had to install Xcode 12.4, by going to the apple developers site.
# For the particular version of macOS we have, the later versions of Xcode wouldn't work.
# To complete the installation, we did
# sudo xcode-select -s /path/to/Xcode.app
# and then cargo b worked.  This seemed to speed up loading by 5-10%, but that did not seem
# like enough to justify using zld.  It might be worth trying again later, as it is being
# improved.
