# Cautionary note.  We set package versions in enclone_versions, but it's not clear that
# this is a sound practice, particularly in the case where a crate outside the enclone repo
# depends on a crate in the enclone repo.  Such an external crate sees "*" and it's not clear
# what is done with that.
