This crate appears to exhibit a bug wherein text is not properly updated in a GUI.
It was manifested on a MacBook Pro (16-inch, 2019) running macOS 10.15.7.  Possibly it is
only manifested in connection with trackpad use.

The bug could be in this code or in a Rust crate that it uses.

Instructions:
1. cargo b
2. target/debug/button_text_update_issue
   - a GUI window will open up
3. move the cursor to over the "Submit" button and tap on the trackpad; do not push to click
   - you will see "pushed" printed in the originating terminal window
   - you may or may not see the button text change briefly to "thinking"
   - the "correct" behavior is to change to "thinking" for three seconds, then revert to "Submit"
   - buggy behavior: this only happens some of the time
   - repeatedly closing the GUI window and restarting may help exhibit the problem

This was exhibited on a MacBook Pro (16-inch, 2019) running macOS 10.15.7.

It appears to be possible to eliminate the buggy behavior by adding the single line

                    std::thread::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_millis(10));

after the line
                    self.compute_state = Thinking;
