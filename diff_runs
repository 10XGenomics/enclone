# Find the difference between the results of two enclone runs, assuming that the difference
# can be obtained by adding a parameter to the first run.
#
# USAGE:
# diffruns dataset-specification old_param | less -R
#
# EXAMPLE:
# diffruns BCR=123085 NDOUBLET | less -R
#
# LIMITATIONS:
# - makes some temporary files
# - makes some imperfect assumptions to do the diff
