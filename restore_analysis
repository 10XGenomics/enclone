<tr>
    <td align="left"><a href="pages/auto/analysis.html">amino acid analysis (just getting started)
    </a></td> <td align="left">everyone</td>
</tr>
5. help5.rs: change "three coloring schemes" to "two coloring schemes"
6. help5.rs: comment out third coloring scheme
7. help5.rs: change "In all three cases" to "In both cases"
