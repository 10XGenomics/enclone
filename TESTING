Notes on testing:

1. Some files are auto-generated.  There are two programs that do this:
   ./build_help
   build_html.
   Run these if needed before testing.  Otherwise the tests will catch the problem.

2. Test with
   cargo test --release -- --nocapture
   assuming that the full set of datasets is available.  Otherwise use instead:
   cargo test --release --features basic -- --nocapture

3. Testing in debug mode (more precisely with overflow detection on) is a good thing
   to do at least occasionally.

4. The code for NOPAGER accidentally broke at one point and we
   don't want that to recur.  Some test cases that could be verified:
   enclone BCR=...
   enclone BCR=... NOPAGER
   enclone help all
   enclone help all NOPAGER
   enclone help faq
   enclone help faq NOPAGER.
   This seems to require manual testing.

5. In OSX Catalina, in full screen mode, at one point enclone appeared to have no output,
   because the output was going to the alternate screen.
   This seems to require manual testing.
