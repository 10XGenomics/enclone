Notes on some testing issues:

1. Testing in debug mode (more precisely with overflow detection on) is a good thing
   to do at least occasionally.

2. The code for NOPAGER accidentally broke at one point and we
   don't want that to recur.  Some test cases that could be verified:
   enclone BCR=...
   enclone BCR=... NOPAGER
   enclone help all
   enclone help all NOPAGER
   enclone help faq
   enclone help faq NOPAGER.
   This seems to require manual testing.

3. In OSX Catalina, in full screen mode, at one point enclone appeared to have no output,
   because the output was going to the alternate screen.
   This seems to require manual testing.
