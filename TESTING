Notes on testing:

1. Some files are auto-generated.  There are two programs that do this:
   ./build_help
   build_html.
   Run these if needed before testing.  Otherwise the tests will catch the problem.

2. Test with
   cargo t
   assuming that the full set of datasets is available.  
   (This automatically runs with -- --nocapture.)
   Otherwise use instead:
   cargo t --features basic

3. Testing with overflow detection on) is a good thing to do at least occasionally.

4. The code for NOPAGER accidentally broke at one point and we
   don't want that to recur.  Some test cases that could be verified:
   enclone BCR=...
   enclone BCR=... NOPAGER
   enclone help all
   enclone help all NOPAGER
   enclone help faq
   enclone help faq NOPAGER.
   This seems to require manual testing.

5. In OSX Catalina, in full screen mode, at one point enclone appeared to have no output,
   because the output was going to the alternate screen.  This seems to require manual testing.
