Notes on testing:

1. Run ./build to build.  See notes there.

2. Test with
   cargo t
   assuming that the full set of datasets is available.  They would have to be in
   the "right" place, and it's not entirely specified where that is.
   (This automatically runs with -- --nocapture.)
   Otherwise use instead:
   cd enclone; cargo test --features basic -- --nocapture

3. Testing with overflow detection on is a good thing to do at least occasionally.

4. The code for NOPAGER accidentally broke at one point and we
   don't want that to recur.  Some test cases that could be verified:
   enclone BCR=...
   enclone BCR=... NOPAGER
   enclone help all
   enclone help all NOPAGER
   enclone help faq
   enclone help faq NOPAGER.
   This seems to require manual testing.

5. In OS X Catalina, in full screen mode, at one point enclone appeared to have no output,
   because the output was going to the alternate screen.  This seems to require manual testing.

6. We allow paths that start with ~ or ~user_name, but do not have automated testing for this.
