These notes address the general problem of finding validation data for denovo VDJ reference
generation.

For such, one needs both a whole-genome reference that has a nearly complete set of VDJC Ig genes,
and Ig transcript data that extends at least from the beginning of the V gene, through the start
of the C genes.

For the transcripts, we looked for PacBio Iso-Seq data.  This is complicated by the fact that
most Iso-Seq data in the SRA is incorrectly deposited.  Typically we observe zero quality scores
and short open reading frames, suggesting that perhaps raw reads rather than circular consensus
were deposited.

vaquita  (Phocoena sinus)

HOPELESS

The following are available:
- manuscript https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.27.098582v1.full.pdf
- assembly = GCF_008692025.1
  * Annotation of Ig VDJC genes in this assembly suggest it is missing IGLC and IGHJ and IGHV genes.
    Cetacean assemblies are generally missing IGLC, but missing these other genes is a bad sign.
  * The harbor porpoise has a 200M assembly GCA_004363495.1.  This assembly is missing only IGLC
    and the two genomes are roughly 99% identical.
- Iso-Seq data = SRX7696401
  * Wrote to phillip.morin@noaa.gov.
  * These data are from a cell line from mesovarium tissue, so useless.  The tissue should have
    few B cells and in any case a cell line is useless.  We found no VDJC transcripts.

==> Wrote email to ask if the data are associated to the manuscript, and if there is Iso-Seq
    data from other tissues.

hybrid cattle (Bos indicus x Bos taurus)

HOPELESS

The following are available:
- manuscript https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/720797v3 (and published)
- assembly = GCF_003369695.1
  * Annotations of Ig VDJC genes in this assembly suggest it is missing 
    IGHC, IGHJ, IGKJ and IGHJ genes.  The Bos taurus assembly GCF_002263795.1 is missing
    IGKJ and IGLJ.  Bos is in the subfamily Bovinae, as are the genuses Bubalus and Syncerus,
    for which we have 200M assemblies.  There respective omissions are:
    Bubalus  - IGLJ
    Syncerus - IGLJ.
- Iso-Seq data from the paper are available at https://zenodo.org/record/4279692#.X7Vqfy9h0cg.
  (Do not use the SRA data which have the general problem described easlier.)  However these
  data are of fetal origin, which we would expect to be deficient in VDJC Ig transcripts.  And
  we find almost nothing.

bat (six species)

ONE CHANCE

- paper https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2486-3.pdf
- Have not been able to find the Iso-Seq data.  Wrote to Emma Teeling.
- List of IsoSeq samples is in Supplementary Table 23 in 
  https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41586-020-2486-3/MediaObjects/
  41586_2020_2486_MOESM1_ESM.pdf.
- It says that Iso-Seq libraries were made for all six species, from brain and testes, and in
  the case of Myotis myotis, also from liver.  Brain and testes would be expected to contain
  very low populations of B cells.

pig (Sus scrofa)

HOPELESS

- paper https://academic.oup.com/gigascience/article/9/6/giaa051/5858065
- Iso-Seq data are in the SRA and appear to be circular consensus in some cases
  * tested SRR5060320, from spleen, found that transcripts of length between 1000 and 2000
    have a median ORF length of 17.1% of the full length;
    alignment to the reference and quality scores seem confirmatory, with some exceptions;
    some VDJ transcripts are there, but many indels
