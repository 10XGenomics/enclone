Notes on building and testing:

1. Run ./build to build, and ./test to test.    
   See notes in both those files.

2. Tests assume that you have installed enclone with the "large" option.
   If you have only "medium" and not "large, you can use instead:
   cd enclone_main; cargo tb
   which tests lots of things but not everything.

3. ./test does not include the very large test given by enclone/src/enclone.test.
   That test can only be run at 10x Genomics because it includes datasets that we don't
   distribute (for example because they're not unambiguously consented for public release).

4. Test speed with ./speed.  This uses datasets that are not available externally.  The 
   particular data used have a very large clonotype that causes the code to be slow.
   [This is not in use now.  There is a speed test inside ./test.]

5. The code for NOPAGER accidentally broke at one point and we
   don't want that to recur.  Some test cases that could be verified:
   enclone BCR=...
   enclone BCR=... NOPAGER
   enclone help all
   enclone help all NOPAGER
   enclone help faq
   enclone help faq NOPAGER.
   This seems to require manual testing.

6. In OS X Catalina, in full screen mode, at one point enclone appeared to have no output,
   because the output was going to the alternate screen.  This seems to require manual testing.

7. We allow paths that start with ~ or ~user_name, but do not have automated testing for this.
