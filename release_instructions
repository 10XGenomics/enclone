1. Merge in changes you want to master, and then git switch master and git pull origin master to 
   catch your local version up-to-speed.
2. Do another cargo b and cargo t to make sure things behave as expected.
3. Type "bump_version" to bump the z version in each enclone crate Cargo.toml, then commit and
   push the change.
4. Edit README.md to reflect the upcoming version change (do this via GitHub.com so that it's an 
   officially signed commit).
5. git tag vX.Y.Z , for instance git tag v0.4.43
6. git push origin --tags (this triggers the release build and upload process)
7. When the release is done, change the title of the release to beta release vX.Y.Z, download the 
   binaries, and calculate the SHA-256 checksums for the binaries and include those in the release 
   notes.
